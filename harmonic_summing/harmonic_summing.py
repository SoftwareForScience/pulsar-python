# !!!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!
# TODO: implement algorithm for higher harmonics
# TODO: 1. make final addition and subtraction dependent on difference between perfect and recorded harmonics.
# TODO: 2. make sure that every recorded frequency close to perfect harmonic frequency are affected.
# TODO: something with the output, maybe a plot or even another filterbank file.
# TODO: ask if power is being read correctly with negative values. (spoiler: probably not)
# TODO: check if frequency.round(3) is allowed and if not, use a trick to make sure DataFrame doesn't truncate column
#       names, like converting them to strings.
